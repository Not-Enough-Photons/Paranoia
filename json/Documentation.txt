OVERVIEW
----------
Paranoia v3 allows you to modify the hallucinations JSON files to your hearts content.
You can change a variety of variables, with various effects on the hallucinations themselves.
I'll plan a system to make your own hallucinations at some point in the future.

VARIABLES
----------
NOTE: If you want to combine flags, check the [Combinable] title before you figure out which ones are.
To combine, simply separate the flags using the '|' symbol.

Some variables in some files have been removed for clarity.
